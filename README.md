### ➕ A little bit more

My first contact with code was through my son Guilherme, who recently graduated in Systems Development, this graduation I am concluding on 12/2021, believe me it is much more than a straw, it is overcoming it is a dream that came out of the drawer never again come back.
I'm very passionate about new tech and all things releated.
